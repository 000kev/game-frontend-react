# React-app-frontend

This React application serves as the front-end of a fullstack application with this [Spring-app-backend](https://github.com/000kev/spring-app-backend) code working as the backend. This fullstack application is a RESTful application that serves a springboot backend with a react frontend web user interface. The application is a team manager whereby a user can join teams, create teams and edit teams with authentication and validation.

# Requirements
- To start the frontend server, run `npm run start`
- Ensure that the port being used is 3000, as this is the cross origin port that this project is set to accept requests from in the backend
